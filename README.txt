QUICK INSTALL
=============
Put this entire directory at:

PATHTOMOODLE/lib/editor/contenteditable

Visit your site notifications page to install the new plugins.

Enable the new editor type by default on the page:

Also - change the order so this editor is the first in the list.

Caveats:

There is no table editing support (but you can cut/paste tables into the editor).
